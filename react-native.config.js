/**
 * This cli config is needed for the coexistance of react-native and other
 * out-of-tree implementations such react-native-windows.
 * The following issue is tracked by
 * https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/182
 *
 * The work-around involves having a metro.config.js for each out-of-tree
 * platform, i.e. metro.config.js for react-native and
 * metro.config.windows.js for react-native-windows.
 * This react-native.config.js looks for a --use-react-native-windows
 * switch and when present pushes --config=metro.config.windows.js
 * and specifies reactNativePath: 'node_modules/react-native-windows'.
 * The metro.config.js has to blacklist 'node_modules/react-native-windows',
 * and conversely metro.config.windows.js has to blacklist 'node_modules/react-native'.
